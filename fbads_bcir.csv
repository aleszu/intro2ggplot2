"2596","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey.

They are not bringing great disease, they are not animals, they do not deserve to have their children taken from them. Much of the instability they are fleeing has been of our own making. We need to step up here and do what’s right. </p><p> As we’ve discovered, a good message travels far, but a good message along with a great deal has the possibility of reaching everywhere. And please share this offer and if you are coming into one of our stores bring friends and family with you, especially those who might have a hard time affording Vanilla right now. It is a one per household deal, and everyone needs to have there own coupon for in-store redemption, but not too many rules or hoops to jump through for an actually free, really nice and valuable little box of brightness. There is so much humanity inside.</p><p> Once again to get your in-store coupon click this link: <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> Nazism has no place in America or any country.

"2597","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey.

Thank you to all the speakers. And thank you to everyone who was able to attend and show your support! If you were unable to make it, we have a short video that includes several clips from the rally, along with my speech near the end.</p><p> I’d like to leave the following closing statement: Yesterday’s Families Belong Together <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">rally in Athens, GA was a very personal moment for me. The current immigration crisis, and how our administration has callously dehumanized and torn apart families at the border—and throughout the USA—serves as a reminder that our country is in fact scarred by a legacy of such action towards others. This is not new. As we struggle to reunite loved ones with their children and families, let’s not keep a blind eye to the history books: from indigenous people, slavery, Jim Crow, Japanese Internment camps, to continuing structural violence today based on race, we must maintain our levels of outrage and enthusiasm for change. We must stay strong and continue to mobilize as we address the needs of all our community members. Though it may seem disheartening at times, I am so fortunate to be surrounded by a community that cares and people who are not afraid to speak out against injustice. Remember, you are not alone.</span></p><p> As I mention in my speech (included in the video), we are currently working right now on legislation at the state level to address issues and others that relate directly to our constituents needs - simple affordable healthcare, quality public education, and access to jobs and fair wages for hard work. But to do that work I must first be re-elected. You can make that happen.  Let’s march together and rally together, and then let’s get out the vote together. It is time to vote 'Blue' and take back our democracy. I have always been the people’s representative - your representative - and promise to continue to do so as you send me back to the People’s House. WE got this! <a class=""_58cn"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/keepfamiliestogether""><span class=""_5afx""><span class=""_58cl _5afz"">#</span><span class=""_58cm"">keepfamiliestogether</span></span></a> <a class=""_58cn"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/experiencematters117""><span class=""_5afx""><span class=""_58cl _5afz"">#</span><span class=""_58cm"">ExperienceMatters117</span></span></a></p>",2,"Deborah Gonzalez for GA","Deborah Gonzalez for GA State House Rep District 117","https://www.facebook.com/DG4GA/",2018-07-08

Here are more thoughts. You can quote me.</p><p> It is a shame that County Executive Steve Schuh has aligned himself with a national political movement that blames local problems on hard-working immigrant families. </p><p> I am disappointed by the swarm of anti-immigrant political mailings sent out in recent weeks by Schuh's campaign advisor Lawr<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ence Scott, accusing candidates of being soft on MS-13 (a gang that was founded in California, not El Salvador) and falsely accusing them of trying to turn the county into a sanctuary city. Scott's people most certainly polled on these scare tactics and you can expect to see more of them this political season. They are an easy alternative to discussing what people care about: schools, development, public safety, and the environment.</span></p><p> I have pledged to end the 287(g) agreement that Schuh signed with ICE because it forces our detention facility staff to interrogate and detain people who have not been convicted of any crime. We have undocumented workers who are terrified of law enforcement simply because Steve Schuh chose to be one of a very small number of counties in the United States to voluntarily participate in this program.</p><p>  ICE has promised to quadruple raids on local businesses over last year's record, and the compassionate conservatives of the past are no longer willing to work across the aisle in Congress to create an immigration system that works. Expect a lot of small business disruption. This is bad for our county and bad for families.</p><p> We are fortunate to have reduced incarceration enough in our county that we had vacant beds at the Ordnance Detention Center in Glen Burnie. Steve Schuh chose to contract with ICE to use the beds to detain immigrants. </p><p> I won't throw the ICE detainees out overnight, but I will work quickly on a plan to expand the drug treatment work that we already do at the faciity. I believe that we can eventually close the ICE facility and open a drug rehab facility.  We can partner with private sector providers and do this in a fiscally responsible way.</p><p> I am a pro-business Democrat, and my campaign slogan is Putting Communities First. Those principles require me to embrace and respect our immigrant neighbors in Anne Arundel County.

There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world.

One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards.

This is one of those moments. There are some acts so wrong-headed, so immoral, and so inhumane that they simply cannot be defended on any grounds. Separating undocumented parents from their children at the border as a way of discouraging illegal immigration is pushing America into dangerous territory morally and otherwise. Dragging young childre<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">n kicking and crying and screaming from their parents, separating those children from their parents indefinitely, locking those children up in cages (“dog kennels”) like animals, and subjecting them to the predators of the American police state: these are acts that no decent people should tolerate from their government.</span></p><p> If you’re inclined to advance this double standard because you believe you have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, beware: there’s always a boomerang effect. Whatever dangerous practices you allow the government to carry out now—whether it’s in the name of national security or protecting America’s borders or making America great again—rest assured, these same practices can and will be used against you when the government decides to set its sights on you.

Leading the charge are member organizations representing nurses, doctors, seniors, patients, and advocates who built a movement to pass the New York Health Act -- our state's universal single-payer health care bill -- three times in the Assembly with huge majority support. Support in the Senate is higher than ever with nearly a majority of the Senate endorsing the bill. </p><p> Combining the relentless attacks on health care at the federal level with a motivated base to win in New York State, now is our time to make sure that New York embraces a health care system that is universal, publicly accountable, comprehensive, and affordable. We desperately need a health care system that will reverse decades of inequality through progressive funding; end the horrors of delaying needed care due to medical costs; and relegate medical-related bankruptcy to a footnote in history books. Advocates point out that this legislation would end the tiered system of care available to people based on the type of health insurance they have, helping to reduce shameful racial disparities in access to care and health outcomes. This important reform simply cannot come soon enough.</p><p> Join PNHP NY Metro to learn more about the exciting developments in the state level campaign to create a just and humane health care system and the variety of ways you can plug in to support the movement!</p><p> All PNHP-NY Metro forums are FREE and OPEN TO THE PUBLIC and WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE.</p><p> Please RSVP here: <a href=""http://www.pnhpnymetro.org/the_fight_for_the_new_york_health"">www.pnhpnymetro.org/the_fight_for_the_new_york_health</a></p><p> SIGN UP FOR LOBBY DAY for the New York Health Act: Tuesday June 5th - <a class=""profileLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/568011673579494/"">www.facebook.com/events/568011673579494</a></p><p> The New York Health Act would guarantee healthcare for EVERY New York resident regardless of income, health, employment, immigration or other statuses.

"2792","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey.

That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey.

Despite the government's insistence that people who present themselves to immigration officials at ports of entry would not be split apart from their children, this, officials took his son away.</span></p><p> José and his son were taken to a temporary holding facility. At some point, José requested to leave his cell to accompany his son to the bathroom. As José held the boy’s hand to walk toward the bathroom door, an immigration official took the boy, who began to cry for his father. They were not given a chance to say goodbye, nor was José told where his only son was going.</p><p> For weeks, José only knew that his son was in a shelter in Arizona — not the name of the shelter, and no phone number at which to reach him. Jose was taken to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, thousands of miles away from his son, where our lawyers met with him to help him fight his asylum case and try to reunite with his son. </p><p> José’s reunion with his son is cause for celebration, but they’ll still face many hurdles in their effort to find a safe life together.

But there are three Kenneth Lougees.  I'm the one from Utah--these opinions are mine.  Please don't bother the other two.</p><p> There are a lot of political issues that are troubling.  We need an immigration system that is both humane and doesn't wreck the economy.  We have never had a President sued by a porn star. But there is one issue that comman<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ds attention.  That is guns.</span></p><p> I'm sorry to tell you members of the NRA but you don't have a Second Amendment right to own  an AR-15 or any similar weapon.  The NRA has tried that argument five times and lost every time in the Federal Appellate Courts.  Heller never said you get to own any gun you want.  Those are the facts that they don't tell you or want you to know.  The courts have you pretty much figured out.  For example,</p><p> True enough, assault weapons can be beneficial for self-defense because they are lighter than many rifles and less dangerous per shot than large-caliber pistols or revolvers. Householders too frightened or infirm to aim carefully may be able to wield them more effectively than the pistols James Bond preferred. But assault weapons with large-capacity magazines can fire more shots, faster, and thus can be more dangerous in aggregate. Why else are they the weapons of choice in mass shootings? </p><p> Friedman v. City of Highland Park, Illinois, 784 F.3d 406, 411 (C.A.7 (Ill.),2015)</p><p> When I lived in Alaska, I was never afraid of people owning guns.  I knew that they were responsible and guns in Alaska are tools which people know how to use and respect.  I appreciate how people look upon guns as a fine piece of machinery in the same way I like quality amateur radios.</p><p> But the Constitution is not a suicide pact.  Even before the Constitution, the first right was always the Right to Life.  It comes before Liberty in the Declaration.  The ultimate duty of government is protection.  Contrary to the myths of the NRA, more weapons which kill multiple people in minutes is not a sane or sensible solution.</p><p> I'm sorry but am a one issue voter.  I refuse to ever again vote for anyone who takes money from the NRA.

"2853","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey.

They are not bringing great disease, they are not animals, they do not deserve to have their children taken from them. Much of the instability they are fleeing has been of our own making.

And please share this offer and if you are coming into one of our stores bring friends and family with you, especially those who might have a hard time affording Vanilla right now. It is a one per household deal, and everyone needs to have there own coupon for in-store redemption, but not too many rules or hoops to jump through for an actually free, really nice and valuable little box of brightness.

No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too. Here’s three great recipes to celebrate the humanity of those the President and his party seek time and again to make appear less than human. Please take time to celebrate their goodness. </p><p> Monarch Butterfly Cookies recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/disease-free-monarch-butterfly-cookies/"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/disease-free-monarch-butterfly-c…/</a></p><p> Fresh Pico recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-pico/"">https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-pico/</a></p><p> Fresh Corn Salsa recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-corn-salsa-penzeys/"">https://www.penzeys.com/s…/recipes/fresh-corn-salsa-penzeys/</a></p><p> Thanks for Caring,</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p>",1,"Penzeys","Penzeys Spices","https://www.facebook.com/Penzeys/",2018-07-08

At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards.

One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards.

Bay Area Pros Support (BAPS) and St. James Infirmary along with other community organizations and supporters will gather at Oscar Grant Plaza in Downtown Oakland to support Bay Area residents who deserve respect and safety during this heightened political time. </p><p> Cary Escovedo, HIV Services Manager at St James Infirmary, a clinic run for and by sex workers, says “When sex work and sex trafficking are conflated, there is harm done to both populations. FOSTA does nothing to help survivors of sex trafficking, rather pushing it deeper underground. And it puts consenting adult sex workers in danger. Without safe ways to advertise and screen clients, many providers are going to the streets into unsafe situations.” </p><p> Organizers of the protest Arabelle Raphael and Maxine Holloway, who are sex workers and sex worker advocates say that sex worker justice is inherently tied to the justice of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC), LGBTQ, disabled, undocumented, poor or low-income, and drug using communities. “We live in a time where civil liberties are threatened by legislation and doctrine. From net neutrality, Black Lives Matter, the Bay's housing crisis, to immigration laws, marginalized groups are experiencing heightened levels of persecution and violence. It is crucial that we recognize sex workers within these struggles.”  </p><p> A press conference at 1pm features Celeste Guap, The Electronic Frontier Foundation, St. James Infirmary, and more.</p><p> Sex Worker Rights Rally &amp; March, Saturday, June 2,  2018, Noon-4pm, Oscar Grant Plaza, 1 Frank H Ogawa Plz, Downtown Oakland, CA 94612, b/t San Pablo Ave &amp; 15th St <a class=""profileLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/619421805075885/"">https://www.facebook.com/events/619421805075885/</a></p><p> Bay Area Pros Support (BAPS) A group of Bay Area advocates that fight for the health, safety and livelihoods of sex workers post-FOSTA/SESTA legislation.

"2932","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey. They are our future.

Our Ground Cumin is something special and key to many traditional Mexican and Central American favorites. The Chicken Taco, though equal parts evolved and traditional, is the Penzey home favorite Taco Seasoning.

We are trying to make it easy for you to spend a little with $2 jars, or free if you spend a little more. </p><p> For more on Ground Cumin click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-ca…/cumin-ground/…/p-937/pd-s</a></p><p> For more on Chicken Taco please click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/chicken-taco-seasoning/c-24/p-516/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/chicken-taco-seas…/c-24/p-516/pd-s</a></p><p> And the time has come to end the dehumanization of Central American asylum seekers. They are not bringing great disease, they are not animals, they do not deserve to have their children taken from them. Much of the instability they are fleeing has been of our own making. We need to step up here and do what’s right. </p><p> As we’ve discovered, a good message travels far, but a good message along with a great deal has the possibility of reaching everywhere. And please share this offer and if you are coming into one of our stores bring friends and family with you, especially those who might have a hard time affording Vanilla right now. It is a one per household deal, and everyone needs to have there own coupon for in-store redemption, but not too many rules or hoops to jump through for an actually free, really nice and valuable little box of brightness. There is so much humanity inside.</p><p> Once again to get your in-store coupon click this link: <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> Nazism has no place in America or any country.

To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards.

"2946","ADL - Anti-Defamation League","<p>Thousands of children, including infants, remain separated from their families as a result of the Administration’s ”zero tolerance” policy for migrants crossing the border. The government failed to comply with a recent court-ordered deadline to reunite children under the age of 5 with their parents as thousands more children who are 5 and older remain separated from their parents Some of the children’s parents have even already been deported. We have seen the horrific images <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">and heard the chilling audio of children being held in detention centers crying for their families. Even after reunification, children face permanent trauma, especially those who remain in detention with their families. The “zero tolerance” immigration policy has caused a humanitarian crisis, and the government’s failure to develop a real organized plan to get children back to their families is unconscionable.</span></p><p> This cruel practice insults our legacy as a nation of immigrants, criminalizes families trying to seek safety, and recalls some of the worst human rights violations in our nation’s -- and the world’s -- history. Tell Attorney General Sessions and Secretary Nielsen to stop this inhumane treatment of immigrant children and families at our border.</p>",1,"Anti-Defamation League","ADL - Anti-Defamation League","https://www.facebook.com/anti.defamation.league/",2018-07-17
"2947","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too. Here’s three great recipes to celebrate the humanity of those the President and his party seek time and again to make appear less than human.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too. Here’s three great recipes to celebrate the humanity of those the President and his party seek time and again to make appear less than human.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too.

In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too. Here’s three great recipes to celebrate the humanity of those the President and his party seek time and again to make appear less than human.

"2985","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards.

"3039","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey. They are our future.

"3056","Penzeys Spices","<p>For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking. <br> Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla!<br> Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  —<br> Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling. </p><p> No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words ""tremendous infectious disease."" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real. </p><p> Even though our country since it’s founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there’s something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept. </p><p> So today and tomorrow (July 6 &amp; 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we’ve risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country. </p><p> To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/…/pd-gb</a></p><p> First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way. </p><p> Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It’s a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside. </p><p> Plus Salsa &amp; Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18…</a></p><p> Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they’ve given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey.

They are not bringing great disease, they are not animals, they do not deserve to have their children taken from them. Much of the instability they are fleeing has been of our own making.

And please share this offer and if you are coming into one of our stores bring friends and family with you, especially those who might have a hard time affording Vanilla right now. It is a one per household deal, and everyone needs to have there own coupon for in-store redemption, but not too many rules or hoops to jump through for an actually free, really nice and valuable little box of brightness.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too. Here’s three great recipes to celebrate the humanity of those the President and his party seek time and again to make appear less than human. Please take time to celebrate their goodness. </p><p> Monarch Butterfly Cookies recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/disease-free-monarch-butterfly-cookies/"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/disease-free-monarch-butterfly-c…/</a></p><p> Fresh Pico recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-pico/"">https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-pico/</a></p><p> Fresh Corn Salsa recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-corn-salsa-penzeys/"">https://www.penzeys.com/s…/recipes/fresh-corn-salsa-penzeys/</a></p><p> Thanks for Caring,</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p>",6,"Penzeys","Penzeys Spices","https://www.facebook.com/Penzeys/",2018-07-08

Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa &amp; Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.</p><p> And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards.

I get letters. The ones from those that support the dehumanization of asylum seekers, labeling them diseased and animals, and the taking of their children all seem to share an intentional disinterest in what actually makes America great has always been dependent on robust immigration. America wasn’t a world leader July 5, 1776, we only rose to that position through the intentional encouragement of open immigration. Right now we are not having an honest conversation on immigration because we are not being honest about what the issues are. In reading anti-immigration emails, here’s the three pieces that are always missing. </p><p> Our immigration laws are not legal. In the 1920s, 300 years of American open immigration were ended to appease the leaders of the KKK and their plans to keep America white. The racist quotas were overturned, but the fact that the limits themselves were racist has yet to be sincerely addressed. To an honest Supreme Court, any law intentionally designed to perpetuate an elevated status for one race over all other races must inherently be unconstitutional. When you hear the term illegal immigrant, please remember it’s our immigration laws that are illegal, not immigrants. Immigrants are humans; there is nothing illegal about being human. </p><p> Our country is empty. People wanting to build walls like to act like there is no room at the inn. The reality is that America has 1/7th the population density of Germany. In traveling the world to find the best in Spices, I’ve found that often, to get to the best parts of the world, you have to go through the other parts to get there. There are so many refugees in the world right now that are exactly like our grandparents and great-grandparents who came to this country with nothing and in turn made this country great. Through no fault of their own, their lives are something we would never wish on anyone we know. America is a life raft with most of the seats empty. To not do more to help more people is just wrong.</p><p> The world is not standing still. At the start of the 20th Century, England and France were super-powers; by its end they were just cultural leaders. There’s nothing wrong with that. Every nation has its season. But do any of us really want this to be America’s fate at the end of this century? To do Spices is to travel China and India. They are growing. They are modern. The model where natural resources once determined the wealth of a nation was replaced by the value of its industrial output. This century, the sum of individual economic activity is the key. To still compete we will need more individuals. We have a choice: get back to the robust immigration our founders intended, or give up our leadership in the world. What’s it going to be?</p><p> Yes immigration has its costs, but those costs are not like throwing away money on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy. Immigration is much more like investing in building a home for our family’s future. The vast majority of us are here in America because previous Americans understood that immigration was a debt we owed to the past that we had a moral obligation to repay to the future. To simply reap the benefits of America’s open immigration without reinvesting in its costs would be selfish. Americans are not selfish. </p><p> And 3 Recipes as promised. The richness of culture each new wave of immigrants brings to America makes us that much better. Tastier, too. Here’s three great recipes to celebrate the humanity of those the President and his party seek time and again to make appear less than human. Please take time to celebrate their goodness. </p><p> Monarch Butterfly Cookies recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/disease-free-monarch-butterfly-cookies/"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/disease-free-monarch-butterfly-c…/</a></p><p> Fresh Pico recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-pico/"">https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-pico/</a></p><p> Fresh Corn Salsa recipe: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/shop/recipes/fresh-corn-salsa-penzeys/"">https://www.penzeys.com/s…/recipes/fresh-corn-salsa-penzeys/</a></p><p> Thanks for Caring,</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p>",6,"Penzeys","Penzeys Spices","https://www.facebook.com/Penzeys/",2018-07-08

"3161","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

"3164","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free $6.95 Cinnamon Sugar ends Sunday 7.22.18—<br> It’s been weeks and the children of asylum seekers still have not been reunited with their moms and dads. To bring attention to this, and as a reminder of just what is being taken from these children when they are taken away from those who love, care, and look out for them, this weekend we are giving away a free, no purchase needed, $6.95 full–sized half–cup jar of our Cinnamon Sugar. </p><p> In giving thought to which Spice to feature <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to bring attention to the reality of the separated children of asylum seekers it did not take long to hit on Cinnamon Sugar. For generations, it has brought smiles to young and old alike at the breakfast table. A couple shakes is all it takes to make plain toast, oatmeal, or unsweetened cereal into a tasty treat. Great for sprinkling on top of baked goods before baking too. </span></p><p> Our Cinnamon Sugar is good stuff, to see it please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/c-24/p-97/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/…/pd-s</a></p><p> What is being taken from these families of asylum seekers is something no government has the right to take, but it sadly is very much in keeping with what America’s Republican Party now has become. What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too.

Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face.

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other.

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry.

"3196","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free $6.95 Cinnamon Sugar ends Sunday 7.22.18—<br> It’s been weeks and the children of asylum seekers still have not been reunited with their moms and dads. To bring attention to this, and as a reminder of just what is being taken from these children when they are taken away from those who love, care, and look out for them, this weekend we are giving away a free, no purchase needed, $6.95 full–sized half–cup jar of our Cinnamon Sugar. </p><p> In giving thought to which Spice to feature <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to bring attention to the reality of the separated children of asylum seekers it did not take long to hit on Cinnamon Sugar. For generations, it has brought smiles to young and old alike at the breakfast table. A couple shakes is all it takes to make plain toast, oatmeal, or unsweetened cereal into a tasty treat. Great for sprinkling on top of baked goods before baking too. </span></p><p> Our Cinnamon Sugar is good stuff, to see it please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/c-24/p-97/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/…/pd-s</a></p><p> What is being taken from these families of asylum seekers is something no government has the right to take, but it sadly is very much in keeping with what America’s Republican Party now has become. What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too.

Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face. Thanks for your help.  </p><p> And also-too, thanks Hunter age 10 for your art. We owe you. Get in touch.</p>",4,"Penzeys","Penzeys Spices","https://www.facebook.com/Penzeys/",2018-07-22

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already.

The return on their election meddling has been staggering to the forces of freedom everywhere.</p><p> Right now so muc<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">h is at stake. Since the 2016 election, so much of the focus has been on who the Russians worked to get elected, and what they did to make his election possible. What’s been lost for the most part of the coverage of Russia’s meddling has been why they took the tremendous risks they took to get this president elected. </span></p><p> The truth is there really is a free world that America has been the leader of for coming up on 75 years. Of course this freedom was anything but free to achieve, and was instead bought at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives, and millions more lives of our allies. The freedom there is in the world has been maintained through these years by America’s commitment to its allies to keep Russia in check in Europe and China in check in Asia.</p><p> We travel the world for great Spices so you don’t have to, and as much as we want to report back to you the tremendous goodness of the people we meet in our journeys, we also want you to understand how so much of the freedom in these people’s lives only exists because the leaders of their countries believe that America is a trustworthy ally. Without the unwavering belief in American support, our allies in Europe would have long ago given in to Russia’s demands just as our allies in Asia would have been forced to give in to the demands of China. We can’t let that happen.</p><p> Maybe, one day, we will learn what it is the leaders of Russia have on our President, and what our President has on the Republican leaders of Congress, or we may never know. What we do know is that they are all dancing to a tune that is not an American one, at least not one we want to hear. Don’t let this be Bye-bye Miss American Pie. November 6 is less than four months away. As Cooks, I’m guessing you’re pretty much all registered. Now’s the time to give of your time and give of your dollars. Now’s the time to set the world right.

"3233","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it. And since we have this belief that cooking is about caring for others it means our posts now fall into the political category.

If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer.

When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing.

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart.

"3244","Penzeys Spices","<p>Our Times are a-Changing, but not our Thyme!<br> 2 Free Thymes ($5.90 value) through Sunday 8.26. <br> —This week the story of our times took the next big step towards its inevitable conclusion. For too long we’ve witnessed friends and relatives giving in to the fear and anger sown by the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda machine. It’s been tough. At times it’s been hard to see where this would all end. This week we learned it will end in our court system, and it will end well. <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">This week was a turning point. This week changed everything. </span></p><p> For more on our tasty French Thyme please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/thyme-french/c-24/p-822/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-ca…/thyme-french/…/p-822/pd-s</a></p><p> To celebrate our changing times, today and tomorrow we will be giving away two 1/4-cup jars of our steadfast, rock solid, and very tasty French Thyme. A combined $5.90 value, the two 1/4-cup jars, one to keep, one to share, are yours flat-out free if you can get to one of our stores today or tomorrow. Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> they are also free, but standard shipping and handling charges will apply. Starting Monday we will continue the two 1/4-cup offer through the following Monday, but the flat-out free will be shifting to a free with $5 spending. If you’re on a budget, this weekend’s the time to get Thyme.</p><p> To get your in-store coupon for 2 free Thymes in one of our stores just click this link: <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a>, just enter “34099C” into the apply code box at checkout. No need to place the Thyme in your basket, the code will do that for you and for free. It’s easy.</p><p> This weekend is also your last chance for both regularly $3.69 Ancho and regularly $4.29 Lemon Pepper for just $2! Chili season is right around the corner, and Ancho is the heart of that and so many Texas, Mexican, and Southwest dishes. Lemon Pepper is a treat and may be our most at home blend wherever it goes. Fish, eggs, vegetables, salads, pretty much everything tastes better with a few shakes. Lemon Pepper is a cross-generational classic for good reason.</p><p> For Ancho Info please click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/ancho-chili-pepper-ground/c-24/p-896/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/ancho-chili-peppe…/c-24/p-896/pd-s</a></p><p> For Lemon Pepper here is the spot: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/lemon-pepper-seasoning/c-24/p-441/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/lemon-pepper-seas…/c-24/p-441/pd-s</a></p><p> In our stores or online, there’s no codes or coupons needed for the $2 Ancho and Lemon Pepper, these offers are automatic for everyone.</p><p> And looking back at this week and all the changes it has set in motion, I think it just became a whole lot clearer where this will all end. For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run. Truly was the best of times, and a needed break from the new Republican “Truth is not the truth” message. </p><p> Our twin boys just turned eight, which is a great age to approach life with a still fresh eye to figure out how it all works. Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much. Ultimately they were successful in their efforts to unravel and get past it, but not before they came up with this observation: “Truth is like Bruce, you can tell it to be quiet, but it keeps barking.” </p><p> After this week I think it’s getting close to the point where we all know where this is heading. The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things. The more likes we have, the more we have signed up for our email list <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a>, the greater the chance we have to make a difference.

For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run.

Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much.

The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous.

You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too.

"3248","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3251","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already.

"3252","Penzeys Spices","<p>Our Times are a-Changing, but not our Thyme!<br> 2 Free Thymes ($5.90 value) through Sunday 8.26. <br> —This week the story of our times took the next big step towards its inevitable conclusion. For too long we’ve witnessed friends and relatives giving in to the fear and anger sown by the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda machine. It’s been tough. At times it’s been hard to see where this would all end. This week we learned it will end in our court system, and it will end well. <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">This week was a turning point. This week changed everything. </span></p><p> For more on our tasty French Thyme please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/thyme-french/c-24/p-822/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-ca…/thyme-french/…/p-822/pd-s</a></p><p> To celebrate our changing times, today and tomorrow we will be giving away two 1/4-cup jars of our steadfast, rock solid, and very tasty French Thyme. A combined $5.90 value, the two 1/4-cup jars, one to keep, one to share, are yours flat-out free if you can get to one of our stores today or tomorrow. Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> they are also free, but standard shipping and handling charges will apply. Starting Monday we will continue the two 1/4-cup offer through the following Monday, but the flat-out free will be shifting to a free with $5 spending. If you’re on a budget, this weekend’s the time to get Thyme.</p><p> To get your in-store coupon for 2 free Thymes in one of our stores just click this link: <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a>, just enter “34099C” into the apply code box at checkout. No need to place the Thyme in your basket, the code will do that for you and for free. It’s easy.</p><p> This weekend is also your last chance for both regularly $3.69 Ancho and regularly $4.29 Lemon Pepper for just $2! Chili season is right around the corner, and Ancho is the heart of that and so many Texas, Mexican, and Southwest dishes. Lemon Pepper is a treat and may be our most at home blend wherever it goes. Fish, eggs, vegetables, salads, pretty much everything tastes better with a few shakes. Lemon Pepper is a cross-generational classic for good reason.</p><p> For Ancho Info please click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/ancho-chili-pepper-ground/c-24/p-896/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/ancho-chili-peppe…/c-24/p-896/pd-s</a></p><p> For Lemon Pepper here is the spot: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/lemon-pepper-seasoning/c-24/p-441/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/lemon-pepper-seas…/c-24/p-441/pd-s</a></p><p> In our stores or online, there’s no codes or coupons needed for the $2 Ancho and Lemon Pepper, these offers are automatic for everyone.</p><p> And looking back at this week and all the changes it has set in motion, I think it just became a whole lot clearer where this will all end. For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run. Truly was the best of times, and a needed break from the new Republican “Truth is not the truth” message. </p><p> Our twin boys just turned eight, which is a great age to approach life with a still fresh eye to figure out how it all works. Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much. Ultimately they were successful in their efforts to unravel and get past it, but not before they came up with this observation: “Truth is like Bruce, you can tell it to be quiet, but it keeps barking.” </p><p> After this week I think it’s getting close to the point where we all know where this is heading. The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things. The more likes we have, the more we have signed up for our email list <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a>, the greater the chance we have to make a difference.

I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this.

This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry.

"3262","NC Senator Floyd B. McKissick Jr.","<p>An Insightful, Difficult, and Disturbing Book about President Trump and his Inner Circle at the White House “Fear” by Bob Woodward</p><p> Today, an article appeared in the Washington Post about the release of an upcoming book by Bob Woodward, who was one of the two reporters who broke the Watergate Story during Nixon’s presidency. Mr. Woodward has impeccable credentials, and he is known for his painstaking detail and thoroughness in the books and articles which he writes. His forthc<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">oming book titled “Fear” paints a difficult and disturbing account of President Trump and his Administration based on in-depth interviews with administration officials and other credible principals. A central theme of the book is that the President’s inner circle is frequently trying to control his impulses and to prevent disasters both for the President personally and for the nation he was elected to lead. I have listed below some excerpts from the Washington Post article some of which contain direct quotes from Woodward’s book (some expletives have been intentionally edited by me). Each bulleted section below is a separate excerpt:</span></p><p> - White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly frequently lost his temper and told colleagues that he thought the president was “unhinged,” Woodward writes. In one small group meeting, Kelly said of Trump: “He’s an idiot. It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.”</p><p> - A near-constant subject of withering presidential attacks was Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump told Porter that Sessions was a “traitor” for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, Woodward writes. Mocking Sessions' accent, Trump added, “This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. … He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama.”</p><p> - After Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017, Trump called Mattis and said he wanted to assassinate the dictator. “Let’s f...king kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f...king lot of them,” Trump said, according to Woodward.</p><p> Mattis told the president that he would get right on it. But after hanging up the phone, he told a senior aide: “We’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured.” The national security team developed options for the more conventional airstrike that Trump ultimately ordered.</p><p> - Cohn, a Wall Street veteran, tried to tamp down Trump’s strident nationalism regarding trade. According to Woodward, Cohn “stole a letter off Trump’s desk” that the president intended to sign to formally withdraw the United States from a trade agreement with South Korea. Cohn later told an associate that he removed the letter to protect national security and that Trump did not notice that it was missing.</p><p> Cohn made a similar play to prevent Trump from pulling the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, something the president has long threatened to do. In spring 2017, Trump was eager to withdraw from NAFTA and told Porter: “Why aren’t we getting this done? Do your job. It’s tap, tap, tap. You’re just tapping me along. I want to do this.”</p><p> Under orders from the president, Porter drafted a notification letter withdrawing from NAFTA. But he and other advisers worried that it could trigger an economic and foreign relations crisis. So Porter consulted Cohn, who told him, according to Woodward: “I can stop this. I’ll just take the paper off his desk.”</p><p> - Cohn came to regard the president as “a professional liar” and threatened to resign in August 2017 over Trump’s handling of a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Cohn, who is Jewish, was especially shaken when one of his daughters found a swastika on her college dorm room.</p><p> Trump was sharply criticized for initially saying that “both sides” were to blame. At the urging of advisers, he then condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis, but almost immediately told aides, “That was the biggest f...king mistake I’ve made” and the “worst speech I’ve ever given,” according to Woodward’s account.</p><p> When Cohn met with Trump to deliver his resignation letter after Charlottesville, the president told him, “This is treason,” and persuaded his economic adviser to stay on. Kelly then confided to Cohn that he shared Cohn’s horror at Trump’s handling of the tragedy — and shared Cohn’s fury with Trump.</p><p> - Woodward illustrates how the dread in Trump’s orbit became all-encompassing over the course of Trump’s first year in office, leaving some staff members and Cabinet members confounded by the president’s lack of understanding about how government functions and his inability and unwillingness to learn.</p><p> - The book vividly recounts the ongoing debate between Trump and his lawyers about whether the president would sit for an interview with Mueller. On March 5, Dowd and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow met in Mueller’s office with the special counsel and his deputy, James Quarles, where Dowd and Sekulow reenacted Trump’s January practice session.</p><p> Dowd then explained to Mueller and Quarles why he was trying to keep the president from testifying: “I’m not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot. And you publish that transcript because everything leaks in Washington and the guys overseas are going to say, ‘I told you he was an idiot. I told you he was a goddamn dumbbell. What are we dealing with this idiot for?’ ”</p><p> “John, I understand,” Mueller replied, according to Woodward.</p><p> Later that month, Dowd told Trump: “Don’t testify. It’s either that or an orange jumpsuit.”</p><p> But Trump, concerned about the optics of a president refusing to testify and convinced that he could handle Mueller’s questions, had by then decided otherwise.</p><p> “I’ll be a real good witness,” Trump told Dowd, according to Woodward.</p><p> “You are not a good witness,” Dowd replied. “Mr. President, I’m afraid I just can’t help you.”</p><p> The next morning, Dowd resigned.</p><p> After reading this article about President Trump and his administration, I certainly hope that he doesn’t see the post I did earlier today about killer robots.</p>",1,"McKissick for NC Senate","NC Senator Floyd B.

"3263","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3266","Penzeys Spices","<p>In honor of the life of John McCain, Saturday in our stores $8.58 of Arizona Dreaming flat-out Free.<br> ——Just one week ago I wrote: “In the last couple years we’ve all witnessed with heartbreak the destruction the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda has brought to the lives of too many people close to us. It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona.

They do very much deserve our appreciation. As we’ve seen here in Wisconsin from our Governor’s attempts to vilify those who would choose Teaching and helping the young as a career, community support in these political times means everything at the start of this school year. Please let teachers know they have your support in the classroom and in the voting booth, too.</p><p> And as we work towards November 6, let’s all be inspired by John McCain’s passion for America. Please start imagining what the new modern American conservatism to come could be. The life of John McCain is a good spot to start this imagining, not just for the values he stood for, but in the incredible strength with which he stood for them. Going forward we will need many-many more women and men with as much of that strength as possible.

"3272","Penzeys Spices","<p>A coincidental overlap of offers leads us to the realization that Fox News really is making America a lot less like America, and a lot more like Russia.</p><p> $17.08 worth of Fox Point and Tsardust, two great blends, free with $5 spending. +Free reg shipping w $25 spending not the usual $40. Ends Sunday 9.23.18</p><p> We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""> for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President’s campaign chairman plead guilty to “Conspiracy against the United States” and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people.</span></p><p> With Paul Manafort’s agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories!</p><p> What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help “fix” our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don’t come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle. </p><p> Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we’ve let Fox be viewed as journalism. </p><p> The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin’s version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they’ve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don’t want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything.</p><p> At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let’s do all we can to keep it that way. </p><p> This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40.

"3274","Penzeys Spices","<p>A coincidental overlap of offers leads us to the realization that Fox News really is making America a lot less like America, and a lot more like Russia.</p><p> $17.08 worth of Fox Point and Tsardust, two great blends, free with $5 spending. +Free reg shipping w $25 spending not the usual $40. Ends Sunday 9.23.18</p><p> We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""> for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President’s campaign chairman plead guilty to “Conspiracy against the United States” and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people.</span></p><p> With Paul Manafort’s agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories!</p><p> What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help “fix” our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don’t come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle. </p><p> Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we’ve let Fox be viewed as journalism. </p><p> The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin’s version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they’ve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don’t want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything.</p><p> At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let’s do all we can to keep it that way. </p><p> This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> This weekend we also have an $11.90 value, two free 1/4-Cup jars of Fox Point Seasoning with just $5 in spending. And we are offering regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano and regularly $4.29 Apple Pie Spice for just $2 each.

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive.

"3284","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already.

"3285","Two Tribes","<p>President Trump has become increasingly isolated as the investigations that have long dogged his White House are now veering into personal territory. One by one, the president's men have turned against him and the walls are starting to crumble.</p><p> First, Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, implicated him in testimony about hush money payments to two women who allege to have had affairs with him. On the same day, his former campaign chairman was found guilty on a sle<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">w of financial and fraud charges. But then came revelations that his longtime friend, David Pecker, the CEO of National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc., which made “catch and kill” deals that helped keep things that might embarrass Trump out of public view, had been granted immunity from prosecution.</span></p><p> Then came reports that Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg was cooperating as well. Weisselberg, the 71-year-old Trump Organization CFO, has worked for Trump companies since he joined the president's father, Fred Trump, in the 1970s as an accountant. The possibility of him answering questions from investigators poses a new danger for the president as federal prosecutors in Washington and Manhattan dig deeper into Trump's business affairs. Also circling are New York authorities, whose actions would be beyond the president’s power to issue federal pardons.</p><p> For Trump and his business, Cohen’s admission this week suggested a potential tax problem, in addition to obvious political problems.  Cohen acknowledged in court that payments to women who said they had affairs with Trump were in fact illegal donations to Trump’s presidential campaign intended to avert bad publicity. The Trump Organization later paid him $420,000 to cover the Daniels payments, Cohen’s tax liability and a bonus, according to federal prosecutors, and accounted for it as legal expenses. Lawyer bills, like other business expenses, are tax deductible. Campaign contributions are not. Authorities, whether federal or state, are certain to ask hard questions about how the business accounted for the payment and whether it was a legitimate expense.</p><p> They are also likely to look back at any similar deals and how Trump executives may have accounted for those transactions. According to the Associated Press, Pecker’s company, American Media, kept a safe with contracts detailing payments to people whose stories about Trump and others had been purchased and squelched.</p><p> The president and his lawyers have given conflicting accounts about the payments to Daniels and Cohen and haven’t addressed any potential tax implications. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump expressed disdain for the campaign-finance charges to which his former lawyer pleaded guilty. “What Michael pled to weren’t crimes,” he said. In fact they were.  Facing years in prison, Cohen said in Court that he paid $130,000 to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels in “coordination” with Trump to influence the 2016 election. That is a crime.  Although it’s never been tested in court, long-standing Department of Justice precedent states that a sitting president cannot be indicted, leaving impeachment as the only remedy to address presidential wrong-doing.</p><p> Moreover, Manhattan’s district attorney is assessing whether to begin an investigation into the Trump business. And the state’s attorney general is seeking a referral to dig deeper into Cohen’s tax matters and related issues. In a civil matter earlier this year, New York sued Trump and three of his children for engaging in a long pattern of “illegal activity” by using the charitable Trump Foundation to pay business, personal and campaign expenses. Trump signed off on those returns. That issue was referred by the state’s Attorney General to the IRS for investigation, as well as the Federal Election Commission. Its status is unclear.</p><p> On top of all of this, the Stormy Daniels case, which had been stayed because of the uncertainty of Cohen’s status, is now free to continue. It is a certainty that her bombastic attorney will do everything possible to take the president’s deposition and ask him questions about the affair and the payment under oath.</p><p> Inexplicably, the president continues to direct much of his ire at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who infuriated him by recusing himself from the Russia probe.  Trump has increased his frequent attacks on Sessions and in an interview this week asked of Sessions’ recusal, “What kind of man does this?” Stunningly, Trump apparently believes that the job of the attorney general is not to protect the American public and uphold the Constitution but to protect the president.</p><p> And, of course, Robert Mueller is silently continuing to compile his case with a possible presidential subpoena looming. And while some may continue to claim that the Republican former FBI Director is conducting a witch hunt, four top Trump campaign officials have either pled or been found guilty.  Two others have pled guilty and thirteen Russian nationals and 12 Russian intelligence officers have been indicted. </p><p> The walls are starting to crumble.</p>",1,"Jim Hester","Two Tribes","https://www.facebook.com/authorhester/",2018-08-26

A combined $5.90 value, the two 1/4-cup jars, one to keep, one to share, are yours flat-out free if you can get to one of our stores today or tomorrow. Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> they are also free, but standard shipping and handling charges will apply.

"3298","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it. And since we have this belief that cooking is about caring for others it means our posts now fall into the political category.

"3300","Penzeys Spices","<p>Our Times are a-Changing, but not our Thyme!<br> 2 Free Thymes ($5.90 value) through Sunday 8.26. <br> —This week the story of our times took the next big step towards its inevitable conclusion. For too long we’ve witnessed friends and relatives giving in to the fear and anger sown by the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda machine. It’s been tough. At times it’s been hard to see where this would all end. This week we learned it will end in our court system, and it will end well. <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">This week was a turning point. This week changed everything. </span></p><p> For more on our tasty French Thyme please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/thyme-french/c-24/p-822/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-ca…/thyme-french/…/p-822/pd-s</a></p><p> To celebrate our changing times, today and tomorrow we will be giving away two 1/4-cup jars of our steadfast, rock solid, and very tasty French Thyme. A combined $5.90 value, the two 1/4-cup jars, one to keep, one to share, are yours flat-out free if you can get to one of our stores today or tomorrow. Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> they are also free, but standard shipping and handling charges will apply.

It’s easy.</p><p> This weekend is also your last chance for both regularly $3.69 Ancho and regularly $4.29 Lemon Pepper for just $2! Chili season is right around the corner, and Ancho is the heart of that and so many Texas, Mexican, and Southwest dishes. Lemon Pepper is a treat and may be our most at home blend wherever it goes.

For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run. Truly was the best of times, and a needed break from the new Republican “Truth is not the truth” message. </p><p> Our twin boys just turned eight, which is a great age to approach life with a still fresh eye to figure out how it all works. Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much. Ultimately they were successful in their efforts to unravel and get past it, but not before they came up with this observation: “Truth is like Bruce, you can tell it to be quiet, but it keeps barking.” </p><p> After this week I think it’s getting close to the point where we all know where this is heading. The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things. The more likes we have, the more we have signed up for our email list <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a>, the greater the chance we have to make a difference.

"3301","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3302","Penzeys Spices","<p>In honor of the life of John McCain, Saturday in our stores $8.58 of Arizona Dreaming flat-out Free.<br> ——Just one week ago I wrote: “In the last couple years we’ve all witnessed with heartbreak the destruction the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda has brought to the lives of too many people close to us. It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona. Arizona Dreaming is a very tasty celebration of the coming together of cultures that so flavors the foods and the lives lived across America’s Southwest. Don’t miss this chance to get yours free.

They do very much deserve our appreciation. As we’ve seen here in Wisconsin from our Governor’s attempts to vilify those who would choose Teaching and helping the young as a career, community support in these political times means everything at the start of this school year. Please let teachers know they have your support in the classroom and in the voting booth, too.</p><p> And as we work towards November 6, let’s all be inspired by John McCain’s passion for America. Please start imagining what the new modern American conservatism to come could be. The life of John McCain is a good spot to start this imagining, not just for the values he stood for, but in the incredible strength with which he stood for them. Going forward we will need many-many more women and men with as much of that strength as possible.

With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3304","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free Kind Pin—$2 Aleppo/Mitchell Street at <br> Penzeys your 2018 Kindness Campaign HQ!<br> For years our pro-kindness message was not seen as political at all. It was only with the advent of unlimited political spending that us doing what we’ve always done became political. Money buys anger, and as the Republican Party embraced anger, racism, greed and all the rest, it found a target in our belief in kindness. </p><p> I truly believe that we never crossed the line into politics, that line <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">crossed us. I’m not saying we haven’t embraced this new role. We are a business by Cooks for Cooks. Cooking works because it gives us the strength to care about others, the strength to be human. Now does not seem the time to back down from all this. So, “2018 Kindness Campaign Victory Headquarters” for us.</span></p><p> What does being the Kindness Campaign Headquarters mean? Well, we are kind of finding our way on this, but already I have much hope for where we will end up. At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when we take the time to care about others a better future is set in motion. In our experience we’ve found that what works around the dinner table works around the world as well. When you care about humans they go on to do amazing things.</p><p> The plan is to start slow and learn along the way. Mostly for the next couple weeks that start will be right here in our home state of Wisconsin where the primary election will be held August 14. Our hope is to take what we learn here in the primaries and roll that out in our stores across the country in a get out the vote effort come this October leading into the November 6 national election. And of course 2018 is just the lead-in to 2020 and beyond. We hope to be at this for a long time. </p><p> So through August 19 really big Kind Heart signs and Red, White, and Blue bunting in our Wisconsin stores, and free $7.95 value Kind Pins with any purchase for everyone across the country.

Where this really tasty Pepper originally comes from is a town in Syria. For a long time, because of the war there, our Aleppo Pepper has come from just across the border in Turkey. Many of those who voted for an unqualified, Russia compromised, openly racist President have so far been spared the costs of their actions. The people of Syria have not been so lucky.</p><p> Many in Syria have not been able to dodge the reality of our election, and have paid an incredible cost for Americans rejecting a well qualified woman who understood diplomacy and how to rally allies to our side in favor of a candidate that has simply given the people of Syria up to the wishes of the Russian President. When this administration inevitably crashes, simply saying we’re sorry to the people of Syria won’t be enough. We have a lot of work ahead of us to pay for our responsibilities. </p><p> Aleppo Pepper is truly wonderful: a little bit of heat and a whole lot of really enjoyable flavor. See our Aleppo here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/aleppo-pepper/c-24/p-878/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-c…/aleppo-pepper/…/p-878/pd-s</a> Get some, use it in your cooking, share its tastiness, but please make it a reminder that voting for change this November 6 is only the first step. We are Americans; we take responsibility for our actions. We must work both at home and across the globe to make this right. It’s who we are. It’s what we do.</p><p> No coupon or codes needed for the $2 price for Aleppo and Mitchell Street Seasoning, those are automatic for all.</p><p> Thanks for having the kindness to cook,</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category.

"3309","Two Tribes","<p>Government is supposed to be transparent. The United States is like a large corporation and we are like shareholders. We own the company and are entitled to see how the officers are running things. After all, the government derives its powers from the consent of the governed. If the public is kept in the dark, then the government’s power evaporates. The Trump Administration is the least transparent in U.S. history. President Trump has refused to release his tax returns and ha<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s waffled on responding to numerous lawsuits claiming that he is wrongly mixing his businesses with the government.</span></p><p> In 2017, Trump spent an astonishing 110 days at one of his properties, including 86 days at one of his golf clubs. While most presidents have visited their personal homes while in office, Trump’s residences are part of his business empire. So, when the Department of Homeland Security spends taxpayer money to move and protect the president around his own properties, some spills into Trump Organization coffers.</p><p> The Trump Organization leases the 263-room Trump International Hotel in Washington from the General Services Administration and pays $250,000 in rent each month. In a sense, Trump is both the landlord and the tenant. One of Washington’s most expensive hotels, it brought in $19.7 million between its opening in the fall of 2016 and mid-April 2017, lending fuel to the argument that anyone seeking favor from the White House has an incentive to stay there. In June of 2017, the hotel’s management admitted to the Washington Post that it wanted to capitalize on the president’s popularity and markets the hotel to groups that embrace Trump’s politics. Although Trump has turned over the hotel’s management to his two eldest sons, he has retained his ownership interest and will eventually reap the profits. Furthermore, since only people who support Trump are welcome, he is getting richer from like-minded people who may want something in return. As a result, Trump is financially motivated to listen to, and govern on behalf of, only a portion of the electorate.</p><p> Moreover, Trump projects are taking place all over the world. The Indonesia government is planning to build a road to shorten the drive between the airport and the new Trump resort and golf course. The Panamanian government took steps to ensure that a sewer system around the Trump skyscraper would be completed. Other foreign governments have donated public land for Trump projects. Since he refuses to release his tax returns, there is no way to know whether his decisions as president are being influenced by a profit motive.</p><p> Multiple lawsuits have been filed regarding the alleged violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, the clause that bans gifts or advantages from foreign and domestic governments and was designed to ensure that government officials serve the American people and not themselves. On March 28, 2018, a federal court judge ruled that the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia could proceed with their case. Maryland and Washington, DC have argued that the Trump International Hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage and that the hotel got special tax concessions. In July 2018 the Court denied a motion by the president’s lawyers to dismiss parts of the lawsuit and essentially sided with Maryland and Washington, DC in their definition of emolument as an ""advantage.""  Attorneys for the president have argued for a more restrictive definition of the term as a ""gift."" The Judge’s order directs the parties to confer and produce a proposal on next steps for the discovery process, which may include producing tax returns.</p><p> This case could ultimately have a significant impact, as could the June 2018 lawsuit filed by the State of New York against Trump, his children and the Trump Organization. That suit alleges that the foundation was ""little more than a checkbook"" for payments to not-for-profits and that Trump used charitable assets to pay off the legal obligations of other entities he controlled, promote Trump hotels, purchase personal items, and support his presidential election campaign.</p><p> Although this issue has not received as much attention as the Russia Probe and Stormy Daniels, there is no doubt that the president and his family are being personally enriched through this presidency in an unprecedented fashion.</p>",1,"Jim Hester","Two Tribes","https://www.facebook.com/authorhester/",2018-08-12

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st.

"3316","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party.

But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3331","Penzeys Spices","<p>Our Times are a-Changing, but not our Thyme!<br> 2 Free Thymes ($5.90 value) through Sunday 8.26. <br> —This week the story of our times took the next big step towards its inevitable conclusion. For too long we’ve witnessed friends and relatives giving in to the fear and anger sown by the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda machine. It’s been tough. At times it’s been hard to see where this would all end. This week we learned it will end in our court system, and it will end well. <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">This week was a turning point. This week changed everything. </span></p><p> For more on our tasty French Thyme please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/thyme-french/c-24/p-822/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-ca…/thyme-french/…/p-822/pd-s</a></p><p> To celebrate our changing times, today and tomorrow we will be giving away two 1/4-cup jars of our steadfast, rock solid, and very tasty French Thyme. A combined $5.90 value, the two 1/4-cup jars, one to keep, one to share, are yours flat-out free if you can get to one of our stores today or tomorrow. Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> they are also free, but standard shipping and handling charges will apply. Starting Monday we will continue the two 1/4-cup offer through the following Monday, but the flat-out free will be shifting to a free with $5 spending.

No need to place the Thyme in your basket, the code will do that for you and for free. It’s easy.</p><p> This weekend is also your last chance for both regularly $3.69 Ancho and regularly $4.29 Lemon Pepper for just $2! Chili season is right around the corner, and Ancho is the heart of that and so many Texas, Mexican, and Southwest dishes. Lemon Pepper is a treat and may be our most at home blend wherever it goes. Fish, eggs, vegetables, salads, pretty much everything tastes better with a few shakes. Lemon Pepper is a cross-generational classic for good reason.</p><p> For Ancho Info please click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/ancho-chili-pepper-ground/c-24/p-896/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/ancho-chili-peppe…/c-24/p-896/pd-s</a></p><p> For Lemon Pepper here is the spot: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/lemon-pepper-seasoning/c-24/p-441/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/lemon-pepper-seas…/c-24/p-441/pd-s</a></p><p> In our stores or online, there’s no codes or coupons needed for the $2 Ancho and Lemon Pepper, these offers are automatic for everyone.</p><p> And looking back at this week and all the changes it has set in motion, I think it just became a whole lot clearer where this will all end. For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run. Truly was the best of times, and a needed break from the new Republican “Truth is not the truth” message. </p><p> Our twin boys just turned eight, which is a great age to approach life with a still fresh eye to figure out how it all works. Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much. Ultimately they were successful in their efforts to unravel and get past it, but not before they came up with this observation: “Truth is like Bruce, you can tell it to be quiet, but it keeps barking.” </p><p> After this week I think it’s getting close to the point where we all know where this is heading. The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things.

"3333","Penzeys Spices","<p>A coincidental overlap of offers leads us to the realization that Fox News really is making America a lot less like America, and a lot more like Russia.</p><p> $17.08 worth of Fox Point and Tsardust, two great blends, free with $5 spending. +Free reg shipping w $25 spending not the usual $40. Ends Sunday 9.23.18</p><p> We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""> for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President’s campaign chairman plead guilty to “Conspiracy against the United States” and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people.</span></p><p> With Paul Manafort’s agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories!</p><p> What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help “fix” our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don’t come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle. </p><p> Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we’ve let Fox be viewed as journalism. </p><p> The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin’s version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they’ve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don’t want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything.</p><p> At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let’s do all we can to keep it that way. </p><p> This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> This weekend we also have an $11.90 value, two free 1/4-Cup jars of Fox Point Seasoning with just $5 in spending. And we are offering regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano and regularly $4.29 Apple Pie Spice for just $2 each.

"3339","Penzeys Spices","<p>In honor of the life of John McCain, Saturday in our stores $8.58 of Arizona Dreaming flat-out Free.<br> ——Just one week ago I wrote: “In the last couple years we’ve all witnessed with heartbreak the destruction the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda has brought to the lives of too many people close to us. It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona. Arizona Dreaming is a very tasty celebration of the coming together of cultures that so flavors the foods and the lives lived across America’s Southwest. Don’t miss this chance to get yours free.

They do very much deserve our appreciation. As we’ve seen here in Wisconsin from our Governor’s attempts to vilify those who would choose Teaching and helping the young as a career, community support in these political times means everything at the start of this school year. Please let teachers know they have your support in the classroom and in the voting booth, too.</p><p> And as we work towards November 6, let’s all be inspired by John McCain’s passion for America. Please start imagining what the new modern American conservatism to come could be. The life of John McCain is a good spot to start this imagining, not just for the values he stood for, but in the incredible strength with which he stood for them. Going forward we will need many-many more women and men with as much of that strength as possible. As Cooks, it’s up to us to build them one meal at a time. </p><p> Enjoy your holiday weekend,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same.

The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things. The more likes we have, the more we have signed up for our email list <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a>, the greater the chance we have to make a difference.

"3346","Penzeys Spices","<p>In honor of the life of John McCain, Saturday in our stores $8.58 of Arizona Dreaming flat-out Free.<br> ——Just one week ago I wrote: “In the last couple years we’ve all witnessed with heartbreak the destruction the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda has brought to the lives of too many people close to us. It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona.

"3347","Penzeys Spices","<p>A coincidental overlap of offers leads us to the realization that Fox News really is making America a lot less like America, and a lot more like Russia.</p><p> $17.08 worth of Fox Point and Tsardust, two great blends, free with $5 spending. +Free reg shipping w $25 spending not the usual $40. Ends Sunday 9.23.18</p><p> We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""> for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President’s campaign chairman plead guilty to “Conspiracy against the United States” and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people.</span></p><p> With Paul Manafort’s agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories!</p><p> What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help “fix” our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don’t come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle. </p><p> Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we’ve let Fox be viewed as journalism. </p><p> The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin’s version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they’ve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don’t want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything.</p><p> At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let’s do all we can to keep it that way. </p><p> This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> This weekend we also have an $11.90 value, two free 1/4-Cup jars of Fox Point Seasoning with just $5 in spending. And we are offering regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano and regularly $4.29 Apple Pie Spice for just $2 each.

"3348","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3354","Penzeys Spices","<p>In honor of the life of John McCain, Saturday in our stores $8.58 of Arizona Dreaming flat-out Free.<br> ——Just one week ago I wrote: “In the last couple years we’ve all witnessed with heartbreak the destruction the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda has brought to the lives of too many people close to us. It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona. Arizona Dreaming is a very tasty celebration of the coming together of cultures that so flavors the foods and the lives lived across America’s Southwest. Don’t miss this chance to get yours free.

They do very much deserve our appreciation. As we’ve seen here in Wisconsin from our Governor’s attempts to vilify those who would choose Teaching and helping the young as a career, community support in these political times means everything at the start of this school year. Please let teachers know they have your support in the classroom and in the voting booth, too.</p><p> And as we work towards November 6, let’s all be inspired by John McCain’s passion for America. Please start imagining what the new modern American conservatism to come could be. The life of John McCain is a good spot to start this imagining, not just for the values he stood for, but in the incredible strength with which he stood for them. Going forward we will need many-many more women and men with as much of that strength as possible. As Cooks, it’s up to us to build them one meal at a time. </p><p> Enjoy your holiday weekend,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. Your comments on this post also go a long way to overcoming the extra barriers being put in the “Political Advertisement” category puts in our message’s way. But we believe cooking is caring about people; these days caring is now categorized as political. Signing up for our email list at <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a> helps most of all. For now, at least no one is filtering that.

For too long we’ve witnessed friends and relatives giving in to the fear and anger sown by the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda machine. It’s been tough. At times it’s been hard to see where this would all end. This week we learned it will end in our court system, and it will end well. <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">This week was a turning point. This week changed everything. </span></p><p> For more on our tasty French Thyme please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/thyme-french/c-24/p-822/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-ca…/thyme-french/…/p-822/pd-s</a></p><p> To celebrate our changing times, today and tomorrow we will be giving away two 1/4-cup jars of our steadfast, rock solid, and very tasty French Thyme. A combined $5.90 value, the two 1/4-cup jars, one to keep, one to share, are yours flat-out free if you can get to one of our stores today or tomorrow. Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> they are also free, but standard shipping and handling charges will apply. Starting Monday we will continue the two 1/4-cup offer through the following Monday, but the flat-out free will be shifting to a free with $5 spending. If you’re on a budget, this weekend’s the time to get Thyme.</p><p> To get your in-store coupon for 2 free Thymes in one of our stores just click this link: <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> Online at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a>, just enter “34099C” into the apply code box at checkout. No need to place the Thyme in your basket, the code will do that for you and for free. It’s easy.</p><p> This weekend is also your last chance for both regularly $3.69 Ancho and regularly $4.29 Lemon Pepper for just $2! Chili season is right around the corner, and Ancho is the heart of that and so many Texas, Mexican, and Southwest dishes. Lemon Pepper is a treat and may be our most at home blend wherever it goes. Fish, eggs, vegetables, salads, pretty much everything tastes better with a few shakes. Lemon Pepper is a cross-generational classic for good reason.</p><p> For Ancho Info please click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/ancho-chili-pepper-ground/c-24/p-896/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/ancho-chili-peppe…/c-24/p-896/pd-s</a></p><p> For Lemon Pepper here is the spot: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/lemon-pepper-seasoning/c-24/p-441/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/lemon-pepper-seas…/c-24/p-441/pd-s</a></p><p> In our stores or online, there’s no codes or coupons needed for the $2 Ancho and Lemon Pepper, these offers are automatic for everyone.</p><p> And looking back at this week and all the changes it has set in motion, I think it just became a whole lot clearer where this will all end. For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run. Truly was the best of times, and a needed break from the new Republican “Truth is not the truth” message. </p><p> Our twin boys just turned eight, which is a great age to approach life with a still fresh eye to figure out how it all works. Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much. Ultimately they were successful in their efforts to unravel and get past it, but not before they came up with this observation: “Truth is like Bruce, you can tell it to be quiet, but it keeps barking.” </p><p> After this week I think it’s getting close to the point where we all know where this is heading. The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things. The more likes we have, the more we have signed up for our email list <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a>, the greater the chance we have to make a difference.

Lemon Pepper is a cross-generational classic for good reason.</p><p> For Ancho Info please click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/ancho-chili-pepper-ground/c-24/p-896/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/ancho-chili-peppe…/c-24/p-896/pd-s</a></p><p> For Lemon Pepper here is the spot: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/lemon-pepper-seasoning/c-24/p-441/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/lemon-pepper-seas…/c-24/p-441/pd-s</a></p><p> In our stores or online, there’s no codes or coupons needed for the $2 Ancho and Lemon Pepper, these offers are automatic for everyone.</p><p> And looking back at this week and all the changes it has set in motion, I think it just became a whole lot clearer where this will all end. For us, this week was also part of a mini epic American family road trip. The grandmas were good to travel so I, Jeri, three kids, two grandmothers and our dog Bruce did a nine-day, three-city run. Truly was the best of times, and a needed break from the new Republican “Truth is not the truth” message. </p><p> Our twin boys just turned eight, which is a great age to approach life with a still fresh eye to figure out how it all works. Somehow around Tuesday, some piece of untruth crept into their play, and I think they were surprised at how quickly it entangled so much. Ultimately they were successful in their efforts to unravel and get past it, but not before they came up with this observation: “Truth is like Bruce, you can tell it to be quiet, but it keeps barking.” </p><p> After this week I think it’s getting close to the point where we all know where this is heading. The truth isn’t going to stop barking before we reach impeachment. And when that time comes, among those not themselves entangled in the corruption, the vote will be unanimous. That will be a good week, too.</p><p> Until then, keep going over your plans to vote November 6, and figure out how you can help others to vote, too. You are a Cook, you overcome obstacles to feed those who are hungry. Time to start working to help others overcome their obstacles to voting too. Cooks rock.</p><p> And in fairness to Bruce, he doesn’t bark that much. In fact he pretty much only barks at what needs barking at. He’s a good dog. Yes he is.</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same. We have some good things planned leading right up to November 6. I hate to ask, but I think we are doing good things.

Get your signed copy, while they last!</p><p> About the book: </p><p> Since the day Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign, the left has waged a demented war against him.  </p><p> Liberals used to pride themselves on their ultra-hipness, but Trump has turned them into weeping little girls in pink party dresses. The very people who once mocked right-wingers for (allegedly) overreacting to every little thing are now the ones hyperventilating and hatching insane conspiracy theories.</p><p> During the campaign, and even more so after his victory, the left went nuts. Everything Trump does sends them into a moral panic. Everything is a constitutional crisis.</p><p> Members of the self-proclaimed ""Resistance"" -- journalists, politicians, professors, judges, comedians, movie stars, Twitter pundits, even Oprah and Lindsey Vonn! -- are literally shaking because Trump is literally Hitler!</p><p> Now Ann Coulter skewers the various elements of ""The Resistance"" -- the pussy-hat brigade, the Russian-collusion witch hunters, the media alarmists, the campus hysterics, and more. They talk about Russia? They're the ones meddling with our democracy by trying to overturn the results of the election with their relentless attacks.</p><p> The biggest result of the Trump era may be our cultural institutions' total loss of credibility.</p><p> Get a signed copy: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2PBg3Dl"">http://bit.ly/2PBg3Dl</a>.</p>",1,"Premiere Collectibles","Ann Coulter","https://www.facebook.com/OfficialAnnCoulter/",2018-08-27
"3376","Penzeys Spices","<p>A coincidental overlap of offers leads us to the realization that Fox News really is making America a lot less like America, and a lot more like Russia.</p><p> $17.08 worth of Fox Point and Tsardust, two great blends, free with $5 spending. +Free reg shipping w $25 spending not the usual $40. Ends Sunday 9.23.18</p><p> We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""> for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President’s campaign chairman plead guilty to “Conspiracy against the United States” and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people.</span></p><p> With Paul Manafort’s agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories!</p><p> What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help “fix” our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don’t come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle. </p><p> Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we’ve let Fox be viewed as journalism. </p><p> The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin’s version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they’ve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don’t want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything.</p><p> At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let’s do all we can to keep it that way. </p><p> This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a></p><p></p><p> This weekend we also have an $11.90 value, two free 1/4-Cup jars of Fox Point Seasoning with just $5 in spending. And we are offering regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano and regularly $4.29 Apple Pie Spice for just $2 each.

"3380","Penzeys Spices","<p>In honor of the life of John McCain, Saturday in our stores $8.58 of Arizona Dreaming flat-out Free.<br> ——Just one week ago I wrote: “In the last couple years we’ve all witnessed with heartbreak the destruction the Republican/Fox News/Russian propaganda has brought to the lives of too many people close to us. It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona. Arizona Dreaming is a very tasty celebration of the coming together of cultures that so flavors the foods and the lives lived across America’s Southwest. Don’t miss this chance to get yours free.

They do very much deserve our appreciation. As we’ve seen here in Wisconsin from our Governor’s attempts to vilify those who would choose Teaching and helping the young as a career, community support in these political times means everything at the start of this school year. Please let teachers know they have your support in the classroom and in the voting booth, too.</p><p> And as we work towards November 6, let’s all be inspired by John McCain’s passion for America. Please start imagining what the new modern American conservatism to come could be. The life of John McCain is a good spot to start this imagining, not just for the values he stood for, but in the incredible strength with which he stood for them. Going forward we will need many-many more women and men with as much of that strength as possible. As Cooks, it’s up to us to build them one meal at a time. </p><p> Enjoy your holiday weekend,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And if you could, please like our page, and encourage those you know who might like us to do the same.

"3381","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

We have this struggle on our hands because we’ve let Fox be viewed as journalism. </p><p> The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin’s version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they’ve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don’t want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything.</p><p> At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let’s do all we can to keep it that way. </p><p> This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> This weekend we also have an $11.90 value, two free 1/4-Cup jars of Fox Point Seasoning with just $5 in spending. And we are offering regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano and regularly $4.29 Apple Pie Spice for just $2 each.

It’s been hard watching conservative friends manipulated by fear and anger to turn against their own decency.” </p><p> One conservative that was in no way turned by any of this wa<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">s John McCain. His principled stance against the corruption of the current President will be forever remembered in America’s history as one of the amazing acts of patriotism that has always made this country great. </span></p><p> John McCain was a hero not for the events that happened to him in his life, but for the way he responded to those events. We all like to imagine ourselves as being capable of turning the other cheek, but the reality is that those who are tortured become the torturers. Not John McCain. He fought the all too human urge for revenge and instead became a powerful voice for decency. And again after losing his 2000 bid for the presidency to a racist attack against his family, his refusal to stoke the flames of racism in 2008 in his campaign against Barack Obama showed so much of the man he was. Heroes in any party of politics are few and far between. We could sure use some conservative ones like John McCain right now. </p><p> There is a long way to go to set things right in this country. But, the decades-long run of the National Enquirer spending big to hide the truth about this president are at an end. I imagine it won’t be long until the day when the inner workings of Fox News become equally exposed. That will be a good day for this country. </p><p> The courts, and ultimately the impeachment process, will expose everything the modern Republican Party has become and after that it will be hard for the party to continue on. At some point we all need to wake up to the fact that what Russia and Fox News have been attacking is not America’s liberalism. Look at any poll or any recent special election and you will see our country’s liberal values are surging. What these forces have been so effective at virtually eliminating from our politics are our conservative values, the very values John McCain spent so much of his life upholding. </p><p> Though we are in for tough times, these times won’t last forever. In what comes next will be the opportunity for a new American conservatism for modern times to emerge. Imagine a conservatism that believes in conservation, and that leads in America’s historic fight for equality. A conservatism that knows capitalism only works when the playing field is even for all. And most importantly, a conservatism that demands the end to profiting off damaging the public good, while expecting the tax payers to pick up the cost of cleaning up. All this is possible but only if we are willing to work towards it. </p><p> Now is not the time to ease up. The future looks brighter, but that brighter future is only possible if we all do all we can to get out the vote. As Cooks we know how to overcome all the little obstacles that stand in the way of bringing happiness to the table. Now is the time to focus those very same skills on helping to overcome all the little obstacles that hold back those around us from voting come November 6. Together we can make the very difference needed now. </p><p> Arizona Dreaming is one of our best blends, inspired by people very much like John McCain with the strength to fight the uphill battle for a more inclusive Arizona.

"3403","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3409","Penzeys Spices","<p>“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this:</p><p> “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.”</p><p> A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. </span></p><p> And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. </p><p> July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works.</p><p> And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery.</p><p> July 3, 2018</p><p> Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. </p><p> The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past.</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. </p><p> I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> Spend every day like it’s November 6th.</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. </p><p> Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them.</p><p> ****************</p><p> And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. </p><p> Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. </p><p> ******************</p><p> If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"3434","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger.

To bring attention to this, and as a reminder of just what is being taken from these children when they are taken away from those who love, care, and look out for them, this weekend we are giving away a free, no purchase needed, $6.95 full–sized half–cup jar of our Cinnamon Sugar. </p><p> In giving thought to which Spice to feature <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to bring attention to the reality of the separated children of asylum seekers it did not take long to hit on Cinnamon Sugar. For generations, it has brought smiles to young and old alike at the breakfast table. A couple shakes is all it takes to make plain toast, oatmeal, or unsweetened cereal into a tasty treat. Great for sprinkling on top of baked goods before baking too. </span></p><p> Our Cinnamon Sugar is good stuff, to see it please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/c-24/p-97/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/…/pd-s</a></p><p> What is being taken from these families of asylum seekers is something no government has the right to take, but it sadly is very much in keeping with what America’s Republican Party now has become. What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too.

Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face.

"3487","Environmental Progress","<p>In the wake of a new report warning of climate change, environmentalists will rally in Munich, Germany this Sunday to demand a halt to nuclear plant closures, which they say are increasing air pollution and locking-in fossil fuels.</p><p> Michael's latest column for Forbes — please share!<br> ________________________</p><p> Over the last year, environmentalists have faulted Germany for abandoning its 2020 climate goals, bulldozing an ancient forest to mine for coal, and exporting deadly air pollution to its neighbors.</p><p> “I hope people see that what motivates nuclear supporters is the wish to leave a better world to our children,” said Iida Ruishalme of Mothers for Nuclear. “We want to let friends of nuclear know that they are not alone.”</p><p> Organizers from over a dozen grassroots environmental groups expect hundreds of pro-nuclear “atomic humanists” to come from across Europe to Sunday’s “Nuclear Pride Fest” in Munich’s Marienplatz from 10 am to 4 pm.</p><p> The environmentalists point to evidence that every time nuclear plants are closed they are replaced mostly by fossil fuels because solar and wind are so unreliable.</p><p> Organizers say the Nuclear Pride Fest will be the first time environmentalists have rallied in favor of nuclear. Their goal is both to urge the continued operation of nuclear plants and to confront what they say is an irrational stigma.</p><p> “At the very least,” said Amardeo Sarma, co-founder of the Ecomodernist Society, “Germany should stop trying to intimidate other European countries to close their nuclear plants.”</p><p> Despite having spent $580 billion on renewables like solar and wind, German emissions have remained unchanged since 2009, thanks its abandonment of nuclear power, which does not produce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> Had Germany spent that $580 billion on nuclear instead of renewables and the fossil plant upgrades and grid expansions they require, it could have replaced all of the fossil fuels it uses for both electricity and transportation.</p><p> And now, energy experts predict, German emissions will rise in 2018, given the closure of a nuclear reactor in the final hours of 2017.</p><p> “Pro-nuclear people are motivated by their love of nature and humankind,” said Fest co-sponsor, Rebecca Lohfert, from Denmark. “The scientific evidence for nuclear is overwhelming and yet it is still taboo to be pro-nuclear.”</p><p> Climate isn’t the only motivation for the protesters. Bjorn Peters, the head of energy policy and analysis at the German Employers Association (DAV) warned, ""Bavaria cannot afford the phase-out of its remaining two nuclear power plants (Gundremmingen C and Isar 2) without severe risks of power cuts.""</p><p> “The cards will be reshuffled when we experience blackouts,” said Rainer Klute of Nuklearia, a pro-nuclear German group. “Gas-fired power stations will increase costs, emissions, and dependance on Russian natural gas.”</p><p> While a massive electrical grid expansion to support solar and wind is “catastrophically behind schedule,” according to its energy minister, Germany’s construction of a new, $11 billion pipeline to bring more natural gas from Russia is on-schedule.</p><p> Germany is struggling in other ways. Electricity prices have increased 50% over the last decade and, despite a 9% increase in solar panels since 2015, Germany produced less electricity from solar in 2017 than in 2015 for the simple reason that it was less sunny.</p><p> Germany in recent years has pressured its neighbors to close nuclear plants by raising fears and threatening to cut off fuel supplies. And in response to recent elections, Spain is seeking to close its nuclear plants.</p><p> Not all European nations are backing away from nuclear. Last November, French president Emmanuel Macron faulted German nuclear closures. “They worsened their CO2 footprint, it wasn’t good for the planet. So I won’t do that,” said Macron.</p><p> France’s electricity supply is 12 times less carbon-intensive than Germany’s. “If European leaders follow the example of President Macron,” said Sarma, “we stand a chance of limiting damage from climate change.”</p><p> <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/10/15/in-wake-of-terrifying-climate-report-german-environmentalists-will-in-a-twist-rally-for-nuclear/"">https://www.forbes.com/…/in-wake-of-terrifying-climate-re…/…</a></p>",1,"Environmental Progress","Environmental Progress","https://www.facebook.com/environmentalprogress/",2018-10-20

Their behavior prompted Senator Feinstein (D-CA) to release the transcripts of the Fusion GPS interviews. In those interviews, the firm’s founder details how Steele was so alarmed by what he found out about Russia’s engagement with Trump’s campaign that he felt duty-bound to bring his findings to U.S. law enforcement.</p><p> Neither of these stunts by Trump enablers in Congress are honest attempts at truth or justice.

His show covers vitally important issues to American society. He often says what no other media outlet is willing to, and most of his information (except as explained below) is true and well-sourced. And he has Creepy Jesus good looks, too!</p><p> *AND* it's important to realize that he is employed by RT, the official propaganda arm of the Kremlin.</p><p> UNDERSTAND THE MODUS OPERANDI OF LEE CAMP AND RT. Lee's M.O. is to draw i<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">n progressives (keep in mind that Russia is also funding conservative media in the US, although not, obviously, via Lee). They do this via important truths about the failings and dangers of unregulated capitalism and corporate control of our elected officials and media.</span></p><p> Once Lee has you nodding along with the ""truth"" sections of his hilarious broadcasts, he seamlessly segues into false propaganda about Russia. There are numerous examples. </p><p> RT's support for Russia's ally Assad is one. Lee (and Abby Martin) casually say that Assad (a brutal monster who has tortured children to death in front of their parents) ""liberated"" areas they conquer (often via horrific bombing of civilian populations). Lee ignores that what is now a quagmire with foreign forces on all sides (most notably, Russia on Assad's side) began with legitimate local protests during the Arab Spring in 2010.</p><p> Another example is Lee's lies (and, more often, silence and omission) on Russian expansionism in Crimea and Ukraine.</p><p> Another is his misstatements of the facts surrounding Putin's assassinations across the world - in spite of video evidence in the UK of Russian agents involved in murdering Putin opponents (a subway camera showing the agents getting off at the stop a few blocks from where a murder occurred).</p><p> Another example is Lee's outright lies and denial of Russian interference in US elections -- while the mainstream media exaggerates it and the effect it had, Lee goes to the opposite extreme of denying it entirely...when EVERY government (including ours) does it.</p><p> I've watched all 200+ episodes of Lee's shows, and many hours of his comedy tours. Never once... not once, ever, does he criticize Putin nor Russia. Ever. Never does he depart from official Russian government positions on world issues. NEVER. Let that sink in.</p><p> Consider again that he unabashedly works for the OFFICIAL propaganda arm of the Russian government. That's not disputed. His paycheck comes from the Russian government.</p><p> Light bulb, anyone?</p><p> Finally, Lee is currently (October 2018) posting about how FB is suppressing his speech and not permitting his ideas to be heard - complaining loudly about FB pages being ""purged."" Well, all of the above in the post was drawn from comments posted on Lee's page and RT's page over the past few days. Don't go look for them -- Lee and RT deleted them all and prevented those who argued these posts from being able to comment on his pages. They don't want these issues revealed nor discussed. That's why this page is being set up.</p><p> Light bulb now?</p><p> In sum -- listen to Lee. I do. I watch his shows. He says a lot of good and true things, things that no one else is saying. But be aware of who he is, who pays him, and look to sort out the propaganda from the truth.</p><p> On a forward going basis, I'll post reviews of Lee Camp's videos, pointing out what's true and what needs to be questioned as propaganda.</p><p>  <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=55izx6rbCqg</a></p>",1,"","Lee Camp Exposed","https://www.facebook.com/LeeCampTruth/",2018-10-29

"3549","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow.

"3596","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery.

As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks.

This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger.

"3663","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year.

"3667","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free $6.95 Cinnamon Sugar ends Sunday 7.22.18—<br> It’s been weeks and the children of asylum seekers still have not been reunited with their moms and dads. To bring attention to this, and as a reminder of just what is being taken from these children when they are taken away from those who love, care, and look out for them, this weekend we are giving away a free, no purchase needed, $6.95 full–sized half–cup jar of our Cinnamon Sugar. </p><p> In giving thought to which Spice to feature <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to bring attention to the reality of the separated children of asylum seekers it did not take long to hit on Cinnamon Sugar. For generations, it has brought smiles to young and old alike at the breakfast table. A couple shakes is all it takes to make plain toast, oatmeal, or unsweetened cereal into a tasty treat. Great for sprinkling on top of baked goods before baking too. </span></p><p> Our Cinnamon Sugar is good stuff, to see it please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/c-24/p-97/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/…/pd-s</a></p><p> What is being taken from these families of asylum seekers is something no government has the right to take, but it sadly is very much in keeping with what America’s Republican Party now has become. What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too.

Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face.

To bring attention to this, and as a reminder of just what is being taken from these children when they are taken away from those who love, care, and look out for them, this weekend we are giving away a free, no purchase needed, $6.95 full–sized half–cup jar of our Cinnamon Sugar. </p><p> In giving thought to which Spice to feature <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to bring attention to the reality of the separated children of asylum seekers it did not take long to hit on Cinnamon Sugar. For generations, it has brought smiles to young and old alike at the breakfast table. A couple shakes is all it takes to make plain toast, oatmeal, or unsweetened cereal into a tasty treat. Great for sprinkling on top of baked goods before baking too. </span></p><p> Our Cinnamon Sugar is good stuff, to see it please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/c-24/p-97/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/…/pd-s</a></p><p> What is being taken from these families of asylum seekers is something no government has the right to take, but it sadly is very much in keeping with what America’s Republican Party now has become. What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too. To learn more about the Quebec please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/quebec-beef-spice/c-24/p-3104/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/quebec-beef-spice/c-24/p-3104/pd-s</a></p><p> To get your coupons for a in store flat-out free $6.95 half-cup Cinnamon Sugar, and for the free with $5 purchase $6.29 Quebec Beef Spice, just click this link:  <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> To get your no purchase needed Cinnamon Sugar online, just visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> and enter “11855C” in the apply code box at checkout. For the Quebec Beef Spice enter “24659C” in the apply code box at checkout, but you will first need to have reached $5 in spending. Don’t place either the Cinnamon Sugar or the Quebec in your basket, the codes will do that for you and for free. Regular shipping and handling will apply but those are always free with $30 spending. </p><p> There’s no coupon or code needed for regularly $3.45 Granulated Garlic and $4.79 BBQ 3001, now both just $2 each; those are automatic for everyone. And if you are looking to maximize your budget you can combine all these offers by picking up a Garlic and two BBQs plus the Quebec and Cinnamon Sugar, a combined $26.27 value for just $6 spending. </p><p> To see our Granulated Garlic, click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/granulated-garlic-powder/c-24/p-1000/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/granulated-garli…/c-24/p-1000/pd-s</a> </p><p> For BBQ 3001 click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s</a></p><p> I’m also happy to announce yesterday we shipped the last of the Embrace Hope boxes. Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face. Thanks for your help.  </p><p> And also-too, thanks Hunter age 10 for your art. We owe you. Get in touch.</p>",2,"Penzeys","Penzeys Spices","https://www.facebook.com/Penzeys/",2018-07-21

That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too. To learn more about the Quebec please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/quebec-beef-spice/c-24/p-3104/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/quebec-beef-spice/c-24/p-3104/pd-s</a></p><p> To get your coupons for a in store flat-out free $6.95 half-cup Cinnamon Sugar, and for the free with $5 purchase $6.29 Quebec Beef Spice, just click this link:  <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> To get your no purchase needed Cinnamon Sugar online, just visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> and enter “11855C” in the apply code box at checkout. For the Quebec Beef Spice enter “24659C” in the apply code box at checkout, but you will first need to have reached $5 in spending. Don’t place either the Cinnamon Sugar or the Quebec in your basket, the codes will do that for you and for free. Regular shipping and handling will apply but those are always free with $30 spending. </p><p> There’s no coupon or code needed for regularly $3.45 Granulated Garlic and $4.79 BBQ 3001, now both just $2 each; those are automatic for everyone. And if you are looking to maximize your budget you can combine all these offers by picking up a Garlic and two BBQs plus the Quebec and Cinnamon Sugar, a combined $26.27 value for just $6 spending. </p><p> To see our Granulated Garlic, click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/granulated-garlic-powder/c-24/p-1000/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/granulated-garli…/c-24/p-1000/pd-s</a> </p><p> For BBQ 3001 click here: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/…/bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s</a></p><p> I’m also happy to announce yesterday we shipped the last of the Embrace Hope boxes. Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face. Thanks for your help.  </p><p> And also-too, thanks Hunter age 10 for your art. We owe you. Get in touch.</p>",2,"Penzeys","Penzeys Spices","https://www.facebook.com/Penzeys/",2018-07-23
"3686","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon. If your not yet on our mailing list now might be the time to click this link and take care of that: <a href=""http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html"">http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html</a></p><p> Now might be the time to share this with family and friends to give them a chance to sign up too.

Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

"3776","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce.

We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow.

"3813","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing.

"3814","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand.

"3815","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free Quebec Spice with $5 purchase because there is a special place in our heart for Canada. —  <br> To see what Russia’s leaders risked so much to gain in the 2016 election, just look at the President’s attacks on the leaders of Canada, Germany and France while at the same time promoting pro-Russia forces in Britain, North Korean leadership, and now even Russia itself. The return on their election meddling has been staggering to the forces of freedom everywhere.</p><p> Right now so muc<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">h is at stake. Since the 2016 election, so much of the focus has been on who the Russians worked to get elected, and what they did to make his election possible. What’s been lost for the most part of the coverage of Russia’s meddling has been why they took the tremendous risks they took to get this president elected. </span></p><p> The truth is there really is a free world that America has been the leader of for coming up on 75 years. Of course this freedom was anything but free to achieve, and was instead bought at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives, and millions more lives of our allies. The freedom there is in the world has been maintained through these years by America’s commitment to its allies to keep Russia in check in Europe and China in check in Asia.</p><p> We travel the world for great Spices so you don’t have to, and as much as we want to report back to you the tremendous goodness of the people we meet in our journeys, we also want you to understand how so much of the freedom in these people’s lives only exists because the leaders of their countries believe that America is a trustworthy ally. Without the unwavering belief in American support, our allies in Europe would have long ago given in to Russia’s demands just as our allies in Asia would have been forced to give in to the demands of China. We can’t let that happen.</p><p> Maybe, one day, we will learn what it is the leaders of Russia have on our President, and what our President has on the Republican leaders of Congress, or we may never know. What we do know is that they are all dancing to a tune that is not an American one, at least not one we want to hear. Don’t let this be Bye-bye Miss American Pie. November 6 is less than four months away. As Cooks, I’m guessing you’re pretty much all registered. Now’s the time to give of your time and give of your dollars. Now’s the time to set the world right.

"3856","Progressive Reality Check","<p>Ok folks. It is election time, once again. </p><p> Right up front, I am begging anyone that reads this to share it, share it everywhere. We need this to go viral. </p><p> I know that you have heard this stuff about how important this midterm election is, but please hear me out. </p><p> The special counsel is busy with his massive investigation of election fraud, and it is has been over a year since it started. Republicans have been screaming and whining that it is taking too long, despite the fact that investigations of this nature are notoriously complex and long lasting. In fact, this particular investigation is like Warp 5 when compared to special counsel investigations from the past where they run at 60mph. </p><p> But the problem is that even if he reveals that Trump has conspired with Russia to throw the election toward him, even if he did violate election finance law by paying off famous women of the sex industry (porn stars and models) to hush about his toadstool affairs, even if he did sexually assault someone, even if he lies to everyone about everything, evades taxes, fleeces the US government through his excessive golf trips to his own resorts, violates the emoluments clause of the US constitution, and/or breaks the law in some way that I haven’s thought of or remember trump is going to have the support of ignorant, backwoods,  half toothless morons that barely have an elementary understanding of civics. Remember, they also have the right to vote. </p><p> Trump has abused the power of the Presidency, we all know this. He  is also one of two presidents that have lost the popular vote, and have collectively appointed 4 judges, that do not represent the majority of the people, to the Supreme Court. </p><p> Republicans have had the entire government in their control for going on 2 years, and have done mostly nothing for the majority of the people. What they have done, is taken every step possible to thwart an independent investigation into the administration that has been underway since Trump has been in office. They have done everything in their power to strongarm the judicial appointment process. Ryan, McConnell, Grassley, Nunes, Gowdy, and any other Republican official that has anything to do with enabling this erosion of the American Government should be removed from office. </p><p> This election is not just a typical midterm election, it is putting an emergency brake on this administration’s abuse of power. It is taking our country back from the Oligarchs that use their money (that they made on our backs)  to buy our government out from under us. It is one of the primary reasons that our country was founded in the first place: We pay taxes and we are not adequately represented. </p><p> Our voices are not heard in this Republican Vacuum. Big Corporations are drowning out our voices by spending massive amounts of money to legally bribe our representatives. They don’t have the accountability of citizenship, or the right to vote, but they have an unreasonable amount of influence in our elections. </p><p> Allowing Republicans to run our government has proven to be a colossal screw up of nearly biblical proportions. It is literally the most important one in my lifetime. </p><p> So, make sure that you vote.</p>",2,"J. Keaty.

"3948","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free $6.95 Cinnamon Sugar ends Sunday 7.22.18—<br> It’s been weeks and the children of asylum seekers still have not been reunited with their moms and dads. To bring attention to this, and as a reminder of just what is being taken from these children when they are taken away from those who love, care, and look out for them, this weekend we are giving away a free, no purchase needed, $6.95 full–sized half–cup jar of our Cinnamon Sugar. </p><p> In giving thought to which Spice to feature <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to bring attention to the reality of the separated children of asylum seekers it did not take long to hit on Cinnamon Sugar. For generations, it has brought smiles to young and old alike at the breakfast table. A couple shakes is all it takes to make plain toast, oatmeal, or unsweetened cereal into a tasty treat. Great for sprinkling on top of baked goods before baking too. </span></p><p> Our Cinnamon Sugar is good stuff, to see it please click this link: <a href=""https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/c-24/p-97/pd-s"">https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cinnamon-sugar/…/pd-s</a></p><p> What is being taken from these families of asylum seekers is something no government has the right to take, but it sadly is very much in keeping with what America’s Republican Party now has become. What is happening at our border is just plain wrong. I think of my own family and just how blessed I am to be able to cook and share dinner most every night with Jeri, our three kids, two grandmothers, and a dog named Bruce. Or how much it means to be together for Sunday breakfasts of French toast or pancakes with minced apples. Better yet, in a few weeks we’ll have apples freshly-picked by the kids. </p><p> A few years back it used to be maple syrup that the kids would add to the pancakes or French toast Jeri makes with so much love. For the last couple years, even though good syrup is on the table, it’s the Cinnamon Sugar that the kids have mixed with their grandma Ruth that they enjoy most. We are so lucky for these moments together. That our government is intentionally taking these moments from families in need as punishment for seeking asylum even though they’ve followed the rules is on all of us. Here, silence is consent. Let’s be done with being silent. </p><p> And it’s not just the humanity being stolen away at the border. In this past year and a half our nation’s consistent voice for human rights has grown ever quieter while a different very un-American voice has taken its place. A week ago the President undermined the leaders of Britain, Germany and France while seemingly giving Russia’s leader the green light to once again subjugate those Europeans living in Russia’s shadow. It was just last month that the White House said there is a special place in hell for the Canadian prime minister because of his defense of American values while we were selling out our Asian allies.</p><p> Our Quebec Spice offer ends Sunday, too.

Through a lot of thoughtful hard work by a lot of good people here at Penzeys, in the past three months we’ve grown to be able to ship far more orders in far less time. And though I don’t think this offer will create the impact of the Soul or Embrace Hope box offers, even though you have until midnight Sunday it helps to get your orders in early. Visit us at <a href=""http://penzeys.com/"">penzeys.com</a> now.</p><p> And please keep paying attention and please keep speaking out. Those still on board with what the Republican Party has become are now openly embracing most everything our founders launched this country to put behind us. This is not to say we don’t care deeply about these people or that they will not be missed. My hope is that in this last week and in the next, we have actually reached a turning point as the tide for whatever this has all been begins to roll back. </p><p> Last week in witnessing the Helsinki summit, so many for the first time finally realized just how dangerous the Republican Party has become to our country and to the free world. This Wednesday, with the scheduled start of the first of what most likely will be many Russia probe trials, it will become harder and harder for right wing media outlets to mislead their viewers about the nature of those they helped to elect. If history is any guide, once the curtain is fully drawn back, Fox, Sinclair, and the rest of the right wing media won’t be able to put this thing back together again. Propaganda by its very nature is a bubble; once popped there’s no patching it.</p><p> So much of what is at the heart of cooking is actual, real, honest-to-goodness human values. If cooking teaches us anything, it’s that when we give of ourselves to take care of others, both their lives and ours become better. As much as today, in this midpoint between last week and next week, it really looks like the tide is turning, it’s up to us as Cooks to hold the line until it officially turns. The science shows that cooking gives us the strength to weather hardships that those without cooking in their lives just don’t have. Maybe August is the month, or November 6 is the day, or maybe it’s 14 years. It doesn’t matter. The line of humanity has to go on. We have the strength to get this done.</p><p> Thanks for caring about people, thanks for cooking,</p><p> Bill</p><p> bill@penzeys.com </p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face.

"3956","Penzeys Spices","<p>Please share this with those you know in business, <br> marketing and with other humans as well. —</p><p> We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it’s a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or what<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share. </span></p><p> I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn’t. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn’t buying is popularity. </p><p> This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. </p><p> The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: “Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.”</p><p> The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!</p><p> And there will be those who say, “Of course you get great results, but you’re just giving stuff away.” Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it’s clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we’ve been gathering together around the fire to share food we’ve learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.</p><p> Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we’d be out of business, but that’s not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.</p><p> In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.</p><p> If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you. </p><p> And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. </p><p> There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.</p><p> Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.</p><p> And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we’ve been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon.

When you care about humans they go on to do amazing things.</p><p> The plan is to start slow and learn along the way. Mostly for the next couple weeks that start will be right here in our home state of Wisconsin where the primary election will be held August 14. Our hope is to take what we learn here in the primaries and roll that out in our stores across the country in a get out the vote effort come this October leading into the November 6 national election. And of course 2018 is just the lead-in to 2020 and beyond. We hope to be at this for a long time. </p><p> So through August 19 really big Kind Heart signs and Red, White, and Blue bunting in our Wisconsin stores, and free $7.95 value Kind Pins with any purchase for everyone across the country.

"3998","Two Tribes","<p>The 2016 election was dominated by something completely new to politics: fake news. The reasons for this phenomenon are multi-faceted, but such an assault on our institutions has long-term implications for our country that will last far beyond a Trump Administration.</p><p> President Trump used the word “fake” more than 400 times during the first year of his presidency. The media, we’re told, cannot be trusted. CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times, along w<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ith others, are “fake news.” After President Trump’s summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un, when members of the media, as well as lawmakers from both parties, started asking specific questions regarding particular details of the denuclearization process that had discussed and agreed to by the two leaders, the president lashed out at CNN and NBC in particular and said, once again, that fake news is the enemy of the country.  But since his post-summit comments contained numerous inaccurate facts and false statements, what exactly, then, is fake news? In its most common usage, it would appear, fake news is anything that challenges the president.</span></p><p> The president’s supporters have taken up his mantra that the mainstream media is nothing but fake news. A Monmouth University poll released in April 2018 found three out of every four Americans think traditional media publishes “fake news.” But constant attacks on our government, by the leaders of the government, only causes further distrust and cynicism and damages our nation’s long-term interests. The media plays a critical role in insuring that government does not overstep its bounds so that freedom and democracy can thrive. However, the administration seems determined to diminish the media’s influence by denigrating it at every chance and even calling it the “enemy of the people.”</p><p> White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to back away yesterday from President Trump’s assertions that the media is the “enemy” of the American people. In a heated exchange with reporters during a White House briefing, Sanders repeatedly declined to state categorically that she did not agree that the press is the enemy. Instead, Sanders blamed the media for inflaming tensions in the country.  </p><p> Earlier that day, experts warned that Trump’s constant denunciations of the press were putting journalists at risk while Ivanka Trump said that she does not view the news media as “the enemy of the people.” The president tried to minimize the divide in a tweet later Thursday, saying Ivanka was “correct” to say the media was not the enemy of the people, clarifying it is “the fake news, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people.” Last night at a campaign-style rally, the president ramped up his attacks, criticizing the press as “fake, fake, disgusting news” and describing journalists in attendance as “horrible, horrendous people,” prompting wild applause from the crowd.  And hours after the Administration’s Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Director of the FBI Christopher Wray, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, NSA Director Paul Nakasone and the president’s national security advisor John Bolton firmly and unanimously warned of Russia’s continuing attempt to attack our elections, the president told the crowd it was all a “hoax.”</p><p> Last week, CNN reporter Kaitlin Collins was chastised by the White House and barred from a Rose Garden ceremony for asking inappropriate questions, an action that stunned the entire press, including Fox News.  Fox anchor Shep Smith said as follows:</p><p> “CNN maintains, the Correspondents’ Association agrees, and we at Fox News observed, that Collins was civil. That she asked relevant and timely questions of a president who often answers questions under identical circumstances and in the same setting. One of our journalists might have done exactly the same. For those of you at home, if I may, journalists are not the enemies of the people. It’s quite the opposite. Our profession is enshrined in the Constitution and the fourth estate holds the essential job of being your eyes and often ears, and when appropriate, your voice. It’s a cornerstone of our Republic.”</p><p> The assault on our institutions, unfortunately, has been extended far beyond the media.</p><p> Federal court judges previously nominated by other presidents, and confirmed by the Senate, became “so-called” judges.</p><p> The intelligence community, comprised of 17 agencies, was likened to Nazi Germany.</p><p> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the independent, non-partisan highly respected agency that analyzes the impact of legislative proposals, can’t be trusted, the president said.</p><p> The Department of Justice and FBI can’t be trusted.</p><p> And, of course, anything to do with the Russia probe is fake news.</p><p> Many years before he became president, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech to the Young Men's Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois on January 27, 1838, titled “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.” Although portions of the speech were about the dangers of American slavery, the macro-lens of Lincoln’s warning was that mobs or people who disrespected American institutions and courts could destroy the United States. Put another way, the biggest threat to the United States would not come from without but from within. “Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant, to step the Ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never…At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher.”</p><p> Lincoln understood that our nation is built upon the institutions that our forefathers built and that we must at all costs prevent destruction of those institutions from within. For over two centuries, our society has been built on these institutions, including the press, the judiciary, law enforcement, and others.  The constant assault on them will have long-lasting repercussions.</p>",1,"Jim Hester","Two Tribes","https://www.facebook.com/authorhester/",2018-08-04

"4029","Penzeys Spices","<p>Free Kind Pin—$2 Aleppo/Mitchell Street at <br> Penzeys your 2018 Kindness Campaign HQ!<br> For years our pro-kindness message was not seen as political at all. It was only with the advent of unlimited political spending that us doing what we’ve always done became political. Money buys anger, and as the Republican Party embraced anger, racism, greed and all the rest, it found a target in our belief in kindness. </p><p> I truly believe that we never crossed the line into politics, that line <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">crossed us. I’m not saying we haven’t embraced this new role. We are a business by Cooks for Cooks. Cooking works because it gives us the strength to care about others, the strength to be human. Now does not seem the time to back down from all this. So, “2018 Kindness Campaign Victory Headquarters” for us.</span></p><p> What does being the Kindness Campaign Headquarters mean? Well, we are kind of finding our way on this, but already I have much hope for where we will end up. At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when we take the time to care about others a better future is set in motion. In our experience we’ve found that what works around the dinner table works around the world as well. When you care about humans they go on to do amazing things.</p><p> The plan is to start slow and learn along the way. Mostly for the next couple weeks that start will be right here in our home state of Wisconsin where the primary election will be held August 14. Our hope is to take what we learn here in the primaries and roll that out in our stores across the country in a get out the vote effort come this October leading into the November 6 national election. And of course 2018 is just the lead-in to 2020 and beyond. We hope to be at this for a long time. </p><p> So through August 19 really big Kind Heart signs and Red, White, and Blue bunting in our Wisconsin stores, and free $7.95 value Kind Pins with any purchase for everyone across the country.

Where this really tasty Pepper originally comes from is a town in Syria. For a long time, because of the war there, our Aleppo Pepper has come from just across the border in Turkey. Many of those who voted for an unqualified, Russia compromised, openly racist President have so far been spared the costs of their actions. The people of Syria have not been so lucky.</p><p> Many in Syria have not been able to dodge the reality of our election, and have paid an incredible cost for Americans rejecting a well qualified woman who understood diplomacy and how to rally allies to our side in favor of a candidate that has simply given the people of Syria up to the wishes of the Russian President. When this administration inevitably crashes, simply saying we’re sorry to the people of Syria won’t be enough. We have a lot of work ahead of us to pay for our responsibilities. </p><p> Aleppo Pepper is truly wonderful: a little bit of heat and a whole lot of really enjoyable flavor.

We are Americans; we take responsibility for our actions. We must work both at home and across the globe to make this right. It’s who we are. It’s what we do.</p><p> No coupon or codes needed for the $2 price for Aleppo and Mitchell Street Seasoning, those are automatic for all.</p><p> Thanks for having the kindness to cook,</p><p> Bill Penzey</p><p> bill@penzeys.com</p><p> And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category.
